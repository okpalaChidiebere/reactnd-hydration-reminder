# Hydration APP
This app makes sure you are drinking enough water. It works by sending you a reminder notification to drink water every 15 mins when your phone is charging. This is because when your phone is charging, you are more likely to be stationary and by water :)

This apps help me learn about: 
- Scheduling jobs and running tasks in the backgound. In the background you can run any code including [fetch requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) [https://www.tjvantoll.com/2015/09/13/fetch-and-errors/](https://www.tjvantoll.com/2015/09/13/fetch-and-errors/
)
- Notifications. On the topic of Notifications, dont forget about Foreground Services. Eg, A music player that is still able to play long after the user navigates away from the actual player audio activity or app. Another Example is when you get directions via google map after you have closed the app. A foreground service is a service that the user is actively aware of. Android requires that the service post a non-dismissible ongoing notification. They are typically used to show the user the real-time progress of a long running operation. Because these notification exists, the user can do some interaction with your service like pausing the music or stopping the service entirely.
